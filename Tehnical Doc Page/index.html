        <p>You’re starting to see that there are lots of places you can add color to your
            pages: background colors, border colors, and soon, font colors as well. But
            how do colors on a computer actually work? Let’s take a look.

            <header>How do I specify web colors?</header>
            <p>CSS gives you a few ways to specify colors. You can specify the
                name of a color, specify a color in terms of its relative percentages
                in red, green, and blue, or you can specify your color using a hex
                code, which is shorthand for describing the red, green, and blue
                components of the color.</p>
               <p>While you might think that the Web would have decided on one
                format by now, all these formats are commonly used, so it’s good
                to know about them all. However, hex codes are by far the most
                common way of specifying web colors. But remember that all
                these ways of specifying color ultimately just tell the browser the
                amount of red, green, and blue that goes into a color.
                Let’s work through each method of specifying colors in CSS.</p>
                <h2>Specify color by name</h2>
                <p>The most straightforward way to describe a color in CSS is just to
                    use its name. There are 16 basic colors and 150 extended colors
                    that can be specified this way. Let’s say you want to specify the color
                    “silver” as the background color of a body element; here’s how you
                    write that in CSS:
                    </p>
                    <code>body {background-color: silver;}</code>
                    <p>So, to specify a color by name, just type the color name as the value
                        of the property. CSS color names are case-insensitive, so you can
                        type silver, Silver, or SILVER, and all will work. Here are the 16
                        basic colors in CSS. Remember, these are just names for predefined
                        amounts of red, green, and blue</p>
                        <h2>Specify color in red, green, and blue values</h2>
                        <p>You can also specify a color as the amount of red, green, and blue. So,
                            say you wanted to specify the orange color we looked at a couple of
                            pages back, which consisted of 80% red, 40% green, and 0% blue.
                            Here’s how you do that:</p>
                            <code>body {
                                background-color: rgb(80%, 40%, 0%);
                               }</code>
                               <p>You can also specify the red, green, and blue values as a numeric value
                                between 0 and 255. So, instead of 80% red, 40% green, and 0% blue,
                                you can use 204 red, 102 green, and 0 blue.
                                Here’s how you use straight numeric values to specify your color:</p>
                                <code>body {
                                    background-color: rgb(204, 102, 0);
                                   }</code>
                                   <h2>Specify color using hex codes</h2>
                                   <p>Now let’s tackle those funky-looking hex codes. Here’s the secret to them: each set of two
                                    digits of a hex code just represents the red, green, and blue component of the color. So the
                                    first two digits represent the red, the next two the green, and the last two represent the blue.
                                    Like this:</p>

            <header>The two-minute guide to hex codes</header>
                <p>The first thing you need to know about hex codes is that they aren’t based on 10
                    digits (0 to 9); they’re based on 16 digits (0 to F). Here’s how hex digits work:</p>
                    <img src="image7.png" alt="salad fingers" title="salad fingers">
                    <p>So if you see a hex number like B, you know that just means 11. But what does BB,
                        or E1, or FF mean? Let’s disassemble a hex color and see what it actually represents.
                        In fact, here’s how you can do that for any hex color you might encounter.</p>

            <p>You’ve now got a few different ways to specify colors. Take our orange
                color that is made up of 80% red, 40% green, and 0% blue. In CSS,
                we could specify this color in any of these ways:</p>
                <code>body {
                    background-color: rgb(80%, 40%, 0%);}</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>body {
                        background-color: rgb(204, 102, 0);}</code>
                        <br>
                        <code>body {
                            background-color: #cc6600;
                           }

            <header>How to find web colors</header>
            <p>The two most common ways to find web colors are to use a color chart or an
                application like Photoshop Elements. You’ll also find a number of web pages that
                allow you to choose web colors and translate between rgb and hex codes. Let’s
                check out Photoshop Elements (most photo editing applications offer the same
                functionality).</p>
